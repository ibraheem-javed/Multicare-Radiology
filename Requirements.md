Multicare Requirements

if the record is maintained as required above, then score as fully met.
if the record is not maintained as required above, then score as not met.

Guidelines
Maintain a comprehensive computerised record/Radiology Information System (RIS) at the RDC.
Computerised record can, preferably, be maintained by using Picture Archiving and Computing System (PACS).

If the record is not maintained as above, then a manual record, including the Physician's requests for the patients’ radiology investigations and reports by the Radiologist(s) are to be maintained. The
records to be kept for at least three (03) years on-site before shifting off-site for future reference.

Annexure-E provides the Government policy regarding 'Weeding of Old Records' and periods for a
maintaining various types of records.

Ind 57: Every record at the RDC has a unique identifier
Check that each record at the RDC has a unique identifier which can be the CNIC number, mobile number or a
number issued by the Diagnostic Centre. The importance of a unique identifier is that there may be more than
one (01) record for a patient or there is possibility that two (02) or more patients that have the same name and
parentage that might result in placing the reports in the wrong record. Assessors should check records with | ae
associated identifier.

Compliance Requirements:
Use of unique identifier numbers for each patient.

2
The medical record number is issued to every Patient and data entry is made against the specific record number. This unique number should contain patient information like name, age, sex, address, etc

Uniquet patient identifiers
All documents of a patient must be consistently labelled with at least one (01) unique identifier so that it can be verified that documents correspond to particular patients. Computer Generated Unique ID Number Is the easiest and correct identification method to be adopted as early as possible. The patient's medical record always becomes a focal point whenever there is a question regarding the care and treatment rendered. it Is important that the medical record be kept accurately and timely. The medical record serves three (03) primary purposes;
i: to ensure quality of patient care;
ii: to provide documentary evidence of the patient's course of illness and treatment:
iii: to facilitate review.

One often thinks of the medical record as a means of protecting the HC E or providing a defense in a medical malpractice action. However, the purpose of the medical record is not to protect or to provide a defense only. The purpose of the medical record, as it pertains to risk management, is to preserve the truth. In reality, a complete and accurate medical record will protect the legal Interests of the patient the VICE, and the responsible practitioner. The medical record will provide a justifiable defense, if one exists, or will indict the responsible party if there is no justifiable defense.

Accurate identification of a patient is the backbone of effective and efficient medical record system. Correct identification is needed to positively identify the patient and ensure that each patient has one medical record number and one medical record with no more duplicates. In order to identify patients, we need a UNIQUE PATIENT CHARACTERISTIC. The type and number of unique patient characteristics used will change from one setting to other, and are defined as something about a patient that does not change.

Some useful unique patient characteristics are:

Client/Patient full name.
Gender.
Dateof Birth.
Computerised National Identification (CNIC) number.
Mother's first name.
Father's first name.
Social security number.
Health insurance number.
In the case of a newborn infant, a physical/anatomical characteristic, e.g. fingerprint or footprint.
The following are NOT considered unique characteristics:

Where a person lives is NOT a unique patient characteristic because it can change.
A person's age is NOT a unique patient characteristic because it DOES change.
Although it should not change, it is important that a patient's birthplace is NOT used, as it IS often Identified by most people as being the place where they 'come from' as opposed to the Place where they were actual born. Similarly, many people are born at the same Place/city/hospital/town etc.
3
Up-to-date Chronological Record:
Information documented during or Immediately after care Is provided/procedure is performed or about an event which has occurred, is considered more reliable and accurate than the information recorded late, based on memory.
Chronological entries in the individual medical records present a clear sequence of care provided or procedure performed, and facilitates better communication amongst care providers. late entries if any, should be appropriately recorded as soon as possible, and should be endorsed by then in-charge.

Minimum Requirements for Patients' Medical Records"
Upon completion, medical records for all patients shall contain, at a minimum, the documents as specified below in addition to documenting the other specialized services, such as emergency care provided to the patient(s) in the HCE:
A unique identifying number and a patient identification form.
Name, address, date of birth, gender, and person to be notified In an emergency.
Provisional diagnosis of the patient's condition.
The name of the Physician ordering examination or procedures.
Patient allergies.
Referring Physician's orders or advice from another practitioner authorized by law to give medical or treatment orders as applicable.
Documentation that the consent of the patient has been obtained and that the patient has been offered the opportunity to consent to procedures for which written informed consent is required by law/regulations.
Sufficient information to justify any intervention or procedure provided, report of outcome of the procedure, progress notes and the disposition of the patient after procedure, as applicable.
The date and time of the procedure/examination.
The name of the professional performing the procedure/reporting.
Details/Reports of other diagnostic procedures as indicated.
Reports from any other consultation/procedure.
Notes from staff members involved in the patient's emergency care, describing the patient's response to medications, treatment and procedures as applicable.
Data or summary data where appropriate, from routine or special monitoring (as applicable).
Time of completion of procedure, description of condition and disposition of patient on completion of procedure (in case of interventional procedure).

Access to Medical Record
The medical record serves as the central repository for planning patient care and documenting communication amongst the patient and the healthcare service providers contributing to the patient's care. In addition to facilitating provision of high quality patient care, an appropriately documented medical record also serves as a legal document for the verification/validation of the services provided/procedure performed. The medical record may be used to validate the medical necessity and appropriateness of the diagnostic and/or therapeutic services provided, and to also validate that the diagnostic procedure has been reported accurately in addition to validation of the site of service provision. The HCE's policy identifies and authorises the care providers who can make entries and can access the medical record to ensure confidentiality of patient information.

4
Only authorised persons access/make entries in the record
Survey Process:
Only authorised individuals can access/make entries' into the RDC record, Surveyors should confirm documented evidence of notified names of authorised persons who can make entries into the RDC record.

Compliance Requirements: Written authorisation of particular staff who can perform data entry
Scoring: if all entries into the RDC record are made by authorised person, then score as fully met.
If there is any entry made by an unauthorised person, then score as not met.

Gyudelines
Existence of Radiology Information System (RIS) makes sure that only authorised personnel make data entries and do record keeping. If no electronic system exists, then an alternative manual function needs to be demonstrated, and focal person should be identified to make entries and amendments by the Manager of the facility. There should be a clear and well informed document/SOP for this purpose if the work is being done manually.

Every entry In the diagnostic record is dated, timed and the person making the entries can be identified
Survey Process: During the review of randomly select. 10% of the reports in the last one (01) year, the Assessors must focus on checking the entries for date, time and name of the person making the entry.
Compliance Requirements: The RDC records are dated, timed and person making entries in the record can be identified.
Scoring: If entries have been made as above, then score as fully met.
if the record has inconsistency to the above requirements, then score as not met.

Guidelines
SOPs for medical record Documentation
This indicator demands that every time an entry is made in the medical record, it is timed and dated along with the particulars of the person making the entry. Recording of date and time starts from the time a patient enters the ROC and seeks care. The first such record is the Register at the Reception and the unique number Issued for the requested investigation. Then, it is the turn of the attending doctor at the RDC who may talk to the patient for any clarification, while putting the date and time along with his/her signatures on the documents, in case of any documentation. The Radiographer also signs and puts the date and time after exposure on the request form whereas the modern radiology equipment records the data digitally on the film and in electronic record. Accurate date and time recording is of paramount importance whenever there is a need to produce the documentation as a proof of certain action having been taken on time.it is a valuable source of data for coding, health research, a source of evidence and rationale for funding and resource management. Hospital authorities shall make strategies to ensure implementation of this requirement.

5
If the reports are available within the set minimum reporting time, then score as fully met.
If the reports are not available within the set minimum reporting time, then score as not met.

Guidelines
Guidelines should be in place for urgent/acute care patient reports/results, as well as normal outpatient/non-acute results.
SOPs should be in place for same day or immediate reporting when possible and adhered to. These documents should be with the Manager and compliance can be assessed by asking the front reception staff or personnel handling the delivery of reports.

Timely Reporting of RDC Results
The RDC defines the time period for reporting on various radiological investigations. Reports are provided within a time frame based on the patient's needs, services offered, and clinical staff needs. Emergency tests and after-hours and weekend testing needs are included. Reporting on urgent requests, such as those from the Emergency Department and Intensive Care Units, are given special attention In the planning and monitoring process. In addition, when RDC services are by contract with an outside organization, the reports must also be timely as set forth by organizational policy or the contract.

Turnaround time is defined as the period of time from the receipt of the request of a radiological investigation with the patient in the ROC till the release of the report.
The Head of the ROC must establish a liaison with the clinical staff requesting the radiological investigations to ensure that requests and patients are sent promptly to the RDC and there is no delay in exposures, reporting and between dispatches of the reports from the RDC until they reach their destination. Any delays that have occurred must be investigated and steps must be taken to solve the problems and avoid the problems in future. The HEC/RDC shall ensure availability of adequate staff, equipment, material, and communication to make the reports available within a define time line.
